<center><b>My Experience Launching This Website</b></center>
     
 Hello! This is my experience trying to revamp my website. Originally I hosted a website (same domain) on SquareSpace where everything was very user-friendly. After putting up many personal non-tech related projects, I decided to dive more into the computer science aspect of my life and try to redo my website with more customization and post more about my computer science experiences. So I used Jekyll Themes and discovered the Moon theme, where I forked over the repository and started to customize it. I also designed a logo for my website because I liked how the original Moon theme looked with one, and I decided to use my initials (T.H.) as a design point. I will be adding a photo of myself- I haven't yet decided where to place it. However the background of this website **is** a photo of me swinging on top of the Big C in Berkeley.
